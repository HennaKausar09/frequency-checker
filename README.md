# frequency-checker
The main motive of this program is to find the number of times a user has visited a particular field.In many websites,all the sub functions are not of the same importance.Some maybe very important and may have been accesed by all users and on the other hand there are sub functions which are of least importance and may have been accesed by only a few users.Thus this program helps in sorting out these preferences in the decreasing order and print the result based on the user usage.This is done by calculating the total number of visit of accesses done by the user.Based on this count the sub functions are sorted out and printed.This is the main objective .this application can be employed by all websites which will help them to moniter the daily activity on their website.Also they can see the most viewed and least viewed subfunction and comeup with new ideas to develop the existing platform.
